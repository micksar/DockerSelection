In order to create the image, you need to cd on the folder of the dockerfile and run "docker build ."

If it fails, try to change the dns from 127.0.0.... to 8.8.8.8 (nano /etc/resolv.conf and add "nameserver 8.8.8.8" for debian systems)



When you have the image and the id from the build, you can type "docker images" to see the available images
and "docker tag <the id> <the name>" to set an alias for the image.

In order to run the docker you have to type: "docker run -d -p 80:80 tag_name"

Type "docker ps" to list the running images and "docker ps -a" to list all the existing images.

Now you should be able to open 192.168.2.10:80 on browser and see the index.html (192.168.2.10 is the ip of my local machine that runs the docker image)
